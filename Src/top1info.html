<div class="cont1" style="color:white"><font size="5">Netflix, of course, is used by multiple people, that being
8.8 million total memberships. Netflix, of course, supplies you with the binge-worthy
television shows and the plethora of movies, but is that the only thing
that keeps users coming back? There must be a reason as to how netflix has
exactly what you are looking for when you log on or even has what you are looking for when you
finish a show and instantly find a new one. Well, I'm going to tell you how Netflix
uses the "terrifying" implementations of A.I. to keep us coming back everyday! </font>

<div class="cont2"style="color:white"><font size="5">Yes! A.I. is even used in the
  music that you listen to. Pandora is at the top for music environments to
  discover new music! If you are a Pandora user like me, you probably wonder
  how it is able to play music that you love without you even asking it. Have you
  ever just sat and said to yourself, "Man, Pandora really knows how I am feeling
  right now!"? Well, there is definitely a reason as to why that is! </font>

<div class="cont3"style="color:white"><font size="5">Just like Pandora, Spotify
is doing really well as a music-on-demand streaming platform. With 96 million
premium users at the end of 2018, Spotify's history shows that A.I. has been the way to
go! If you have a Spotify account and wish to learn a lot
more about how you are interacting with A.I. and actually playing a part in Spotify's ongoing success,
as well as how A.I. can understand your music please... </font>
